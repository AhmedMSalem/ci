# User Stories
## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to find the best way to expose the main interactions in our UI. Defining the goals of the users and translating them to the actions needed to attain the goal will allow us to ensure our UI will be able to give the best experience. These User goals are generally written for a mobile-focused CI as to not limit ourselves to what we currently have implemented, but what the user would like to do with a CI.
