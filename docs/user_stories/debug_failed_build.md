### As a developer, with a PR that fails to build, I want to find the root cause so I can fix it
#### Assumptions
* fastlane.ci already set up
* User has Project with test lane and PR trigger.
* User is already logged in
#### User Journey
1. GitHub notifies user that build failed
1. User accesses logs and build outputs
1. User locates failure and starts fixing failure
1. User commits fix
1. fastlane.ci rebuilds automatically
1. Userâ€™s Build passes
1. User merges PR
#### Use Case
1. GitHub updates status on commit to indicate the build failed for that commit
1. User opens fastlane.ci dashboard
1. User opens Project for their Repo + branch
1. User types in their name to filter
1. User clicks on their Build
1. User types in App package name or bundle id into filter
1. User finds stacktrace
1. User fixes bug in their code
1. User builds locally
1. User commits the fix
1. User waits for build to automatically kick off and complete
1. User merges PR now that build is successful
